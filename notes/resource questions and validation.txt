1. introduction
	research questions
	1. How can we device a platform that enables processing sensor device monitoring data, such that:
		a. adoptation and implementation of the platform requires low effort.
		b. it can process huge volumes of input data, and
	2. How can we model and calculate the QoS of a system for the purpose of
		a. representing the state of the system
		b. calculating the optimal mannor of operation for the system
	
2. background
	existing platforms
	microservice architecture (c4)
	Quality of Information (c4)
	Variety/commonallity analysis (c3,c4)
	development method (design science methodology) (c3,c4)
	
3. architecture
	Draft chapter submitted

4. Resource Distribution Model
	Draft chapter submitted

5. Proof of concept: Nedap
	Prototype implementation for (simulation of) Nedap Identification Systems' parking sensor WSN application.
	simulation is based on actual sensor data and sensor behaviour
	some features may be added to simulation environment which are not present in Nedap application (eg. sensor behaviour configuration by automated feedback channels). This ensures validation of those additional features.
	
	Evaluated on:
	1. fitness of the model and the architecture by ease of implementation
		a. Lines of code and development time required
		b. Answers research question 1a & 1b
	2. scalablity and capacity by subjecting the implementation to a large volume of data 
		a. Show no bottleneck occurs (are avoidable)
		b. Measure timeliness of the sistem, i.e. information  that enters the platform is processed and returned in a timely manner, eighter real-time or on timed interval
		Answers research question 2a
	
	research question 2b is not validated in this chapter as solvability is provided by the design of the model and the solver

where to put development cycles
where to describe example case
are rdd's in window retained or recalculated?
