context
	proliforation of devices
	probebly thinking consumer electronics
	especially WSN 
	specifically LPWA (show apparaat)
		cheap/low data (kb per day)/high range(cell network)
		large scale
		explosion (15-30 billion)
	movement shared network (up ot 10.000 per cell)
	previous screams for performance monitoring
		Term coined is QoS
		what is offered
		what can we offer
	this study set out to enable this

		distributed architecture
		rdm
	validation by proof-of-concept
	conclusions
problem
	general purpose exists (protocols, applications, development platforms)
	chain (problems cross out)
	resources (no device)
		restricted processing (raw kpi)
		short, scheduled duty cycle (no wake up guarentee)
	mobile operators (no network)
	iot is different (ultimately back end)
(current state of art)
goal
rq
	two artefacts
		How can we design abstract platform for scalable processing of streams of raw KPI indicators !!!! vroeg definieren wat platform is: rapid development and evolution of specific appliations
		how can we model the state and evaluate the performance (QoS) of a configurable system (what is system?)
	terms clarification
approach
	development platform 
	modelling technique 
		measured state
		calculated performance
		variations due to configurable behavior
	proof of concept validation (to be continued)
architecture
	design approach
	c/v analysis
		scalable
		multi-level reporting
		three streams	
	design
		scalable
			microcomponent arch
				also allows multi-level reporting
		streams dus storm
			build upon with adaptations
			topics
		"feature" diagram
			single snapshot
				SingleMessageProcessor
				RDM-Processor
			longitudinal
				HistoricBufferedProcessor
					internal
				DatabaseBufferedProcessor
					scaffolding to store buffer in db
			latteral
				Accumulator
					not distributed can be chained
				DistributedAccumulatorProcessor
					new slide
		spark streaming
			fastest
			no integration with storm

		represent state, calculate QoS
		based on kpi and configurable behavior

	claims & method
		applicability
			can it be done?
		usabiblity
			no more than monolyth
			4 per arch comp

		adaptability
			3 suggested extensions
			hypothesize the consequences
			2 components new/changed local changes to topology

		simulation
	demo

	results/evaluation
		applicability pass
		usabilty
			topology pass
			nr lines fail
		adaptability pass
	discussion
		parsing/casting/accessing
			absolved by structs
		difficult going back and forth
			GUI
conclusion
	conclusions
		promising platform architecture, with some defficiencies
		model (promising)
			captivates resource distribution
			describes variable behaviour
			explored efficciently
			
	Discussion
		similar to storm & fault tolerant features not included
		limited validation
			not blind
			just one app
		no scalabilty validation
	Future work 
		suggested addittions
		redo with storm
		further validation
			more applications
			blind studies
			scalability
